The Vegaâ€™s heart is backend platform that is responsible for fare and customer management, payments and boarding process. Communication between backend components is fully asynchronically and message-driven.

API Gateway provides a centralized proxy for external calls to backend component from fronted and terminal. Frontend is a standalone JS application, while Boarding Terminal is operated by its firmware. Both, Frontend and Boarding Terminal consume REST Gateway's API.
