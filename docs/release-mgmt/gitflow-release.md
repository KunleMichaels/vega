# GitFlow Release

Once `develop` has acquired enough features for a release (or a predetermined release date is approaching), a release branch will be forked off of `develop`. Creating this branch starts the next release cycle, so no new features can be added after this pointâ€”only bug fixes, documentation generation, and other release-oriented tasks should go in this branch. Once it's ready to ship, the release gets merged into `master` and tagged with a version number. In addition, it should be merged back into `develop`, which may have progressed since the release was initiated.
