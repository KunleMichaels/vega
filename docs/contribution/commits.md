# Commit messages

Please follow this guide to write commit messages consistently and correctly.

## Commit structure
```
Capitalized, short (50 chars or less) summary

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to about 72
characters or so.  In some contexts, the first line is treated as the
subject of an email and the rest of the text as the body.  The blank
line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit
the body entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run the
two together.

Write your commit message in the present tense: "Fix bug" and not "Fixed
bug."  This convention matches up with commit messages generated by
commands like git merge and git revert.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

- Bullet points are okay, too

- Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a
  single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here

- Use a hanging indent
```

**Before you commit, make sure that:**
* First line is short, <= 50 chars
* **You live the second line blank**
* Each line in commit body is less then 72
* **Commit message is meaningful. It says what the change includes and why.**
* **The summary starts with a verb in the present tense** (e.g. Add, change, fix etc.).

## Examples

**Good commit:**
```
git commit -m "Add instructions to help setup gmail 2FA \
\
For those who use two-factor authentication with gmail, git-send-email \
will not work unless it is setup with an app-specific password. \
The example for setting up git-send-email for use with gmail will now \
include information on generating and storing the app-specific password."
```
Short title < 50 ?, empty line after title ?, clear statement ?, the summary starts with a verb in the present tense ?, each line in commit body is less then 72 ?

**Bad commit:**
```
git commit -m "Initial API implementation \
Rename repository to spica-deployments \
Cleanup project after project renaming"
```
Short title < 50 ?, empty line after title ?, clear statement ? (no statement at all)
