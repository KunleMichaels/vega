# Filing Issues
Each issue/feature/bugfix must be described as a GitHub issue to maintained GitHub Project Board and to ensure that everything is documented. Before you begin, perform a web / GitHub search to avoid creating a duplicate ticket. 

**If you are filing an issue to request a feature**, please provide a clear description of the feature. It can be helpful to describe answers to the following questions:
* **Who will use the feature?**
* **When will they use the feature?**
* **What is the userâ€™s goal?**

**If you are filing an issue to report a bug**, please provide:
* **A clear description of the bug and related expectations.** Consider using the following example template for reporting a bug:

 ```markdown
 The `paper-foo` element causes the page to turn pink when clicked.

 ## Expected outcome

 The page stays the same color.

 ## Actual outcome

 The page turns pink.

 ## Steps to reproduce

 1. Put a `paper-foo` element in the page.
 2. Open the page in a web browser.
 3. Click the `paper-foo` element.
 ```

* **A reduced test case that demonstrates the problem.**
